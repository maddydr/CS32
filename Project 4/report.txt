1. I was able to finish everything.
2. Possibly might not have put all helper functions at the top of the cpp files like requested in the spec
3. Did not use any banned STL containers






I did case sensitive inputs to ensure my makeLower function was correct. For directors, actors, and movie ID’s, I put random capitalization in the names to be sure I still got the correct output. I also tested my code by requesting a negative number of movies to ensure I returned an empty vector. I also tried running the code with a smaller file with fewer movies and users to ensure correct behavior. I checked if the user requested more movies than even in the database, that this should return as many as it can. 


I tested my treemm by outputting statements after a tree was initialized to ensure items were inputted correctly. I also tested my User class by using the debugger to make sure emails kept their case sensitivity. I tested userDataBase alone to ensure that it could correctly retrieve users alone. I tested the movieDataBase by trying to get movies based in ID’s, actors, directors, and genres. Once each individual component of retrieval was correct, I implemented recommender. 


I tested recommender by calculating scores based solely on directors, solely on actors, and then solely on genres. I did this with individualized hash tables. One all categories were computing the right scores, I had to test my sort function by testing it with results that had ties, and the same movie ratings.
